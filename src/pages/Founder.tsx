              My Journey to Financial Consulting

              <p>
                I did not set out to build a financial consulting firm. I set out to understand why 
                families like mine—hardworking, intelligent, committed—were still vulnerable when life 
                shifted without warning.
              </p>

              <p className="font-semibold text-xl text-primary">
                My journey begins in 2013, when I lost my father.
              </p>

              <p>
                It was more than a personal loss. It was an awakening. A sobering realization that even 
                the strongest families can crumble financially when preparation is missing. That moment 
                forced me to confront a hard truth:

                <CardContent className="p-6">
                  <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary italic">
                    Most families are one crisis away from collapse, not because they lack intelligence, 
                    but because no one ever taught them the rules.

              <p>
                For nearly two decades, I lived as an engineer. Eighteen years in the automotive and 
                aerospace industries. Designing systems. Solving problems. Leading multi-million-dollar 
                projects from cradle to grave. Serving as a Subject Matter Expert in vehicle 
                electrification, systems integration, wiring design strategies, troubleshooting, and 
                manufacturing support.
              </p>

              <p>
                I was known as the man who could bring clarity where others saw complexity. Yet behind 
                the scenes, my own finances told a different story.
              </p>

              <p className="font-semibold text-foreground">
                Despite the titles, the degrees, and the accomplishments, I was living paycheck to 
                paycheck. Disciplined professionally, but financially fragile personally.
              </p>

              <p>Then something shifted.</p>

              <p>
                I pursued a Master's degree in Management with an emphasis in Technology. I devoured 
                everything I could about leadership, stewardship, and financial literacy. I started to 
                recognize that the real problem for most families was not lack of income—it was lack of 
                knowledge, lack of guidance, and lack of a foundation that could withstand life's volatility.
              </p>

              <p>
                What began as curiosity became conviction. What began as learning became calling.
              </p>

              <p className="font-semibold text-xl text-primary">
                That calling eventually became KB&K Legacy Shield.
              </p>

              <p>
                I built this firm to shield families from the very vulnerability I once lived. To teach 
                what I was never taught. To illuminate what most people never see. To help households 
                protect what matters, build what lasts, and rise into generational strength.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, I serve as both an engineer and a financial professional—two worlds that actually 
                complement each other more than people realize.
